**Note:** This project is no longer maintained. I have learned *a lot* about building good library projects while building this project. Mac is simply a really badly written library. It's very opinionated, it comes bundled with a networking and database library, it is confusing to use, and it has some potential issues. Not a very good project. Instead, use [Wendy-iOS](https://github.com/levibostian/wendy-ios). Wendy-iOS is what Mac was meant to be. It's no opinionated, does not come with networking or a database, very flexible and easy to use, works hard to handle all potential use cases. It works much better and is maintained. 

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

Mac is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Mac"
```
